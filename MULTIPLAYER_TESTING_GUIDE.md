# üéØ Multiplayer Testing Guide - SignBuddy Application

## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. **Two Android Devices**
- Both devices must have the SignBuddy app installed
- Both devices must be connected to the internet (can be on different networks)
- Both devices should have camera permissions enabled

### 2. **Firebase Configuration**
- Ensure `google-services.json` is properly configured
- Firebase Realtime Database rules should allow read/write access
- Check that both devices can connect to Firebase

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Testing Instructions

### **Phase 1: Initial Setup**

#### **Step 1: Launch the App on Both Devices**
1. Open SignBuddy app on **Device 1** (Host)
2. Open SignBuddy app on **Device 2** (Joiner)
3. Navigate to the Multiplayer screen on both devices

#### **Step 2: Create Room (Host)**
1. On **Device 1**, tap "Create Room"
2. Enter a player name (e.g., "Player1")
3. Note the **Room Code** displayed (e.g., "ABC123")
4. Wait for "Waiting for opponent..." message

#### **Step 3: Join Room (Joiner)**
1. On **Device 2**, tap "Join Room"
2. Enter the same **Room Code** from Step 2
3. Enter a player name (e.g., "Player2")
4. Tap "Join"

### **Phase 2: Connection Verification**

#### **Step 4: Verify Connection**
- **Device 1** should show "Opponent found: Player2"
- **Device 2** should show "Connected to room"
- Both devices should automatically proceed to countdown (3, 2, 1, GO!)

#### **Step 5: Check Logs (Important for Debugging)**
1. Open Android Studio on your development machine
2. Connect both devices via USB debugging
3. Open Logcat and filter by "MultiplayerScreen" and "MultiplayerViewModel"
4. Look for these key log messages:
   - `=== STARTING MESSAGE LISTENER ===`
   - `=== MESSAGE RECEIVED ===`
   - `=== SENDING MESSAGE ===`
   - `=== ANSWER SUBMITTED MESSAGE RECEIVED ===`

### **Phase 3: Scoring Test**

#### **Step 6: Test Manual Scoring (Quick Test)**
1. Once in the game screen, look for the **"TEST SCORE (+10)"** button
2. Tap this button on **Device 1**
3. **Expected Result**: Both devices should show +10 points for Player1
4. Tap this button on **Device 2**
5. **Expected Result**: Both devices should show +10 points for Player2

#### **Step 7: Test Hand Sign Detection**
1. Position your hand in front of the camera on **Device 1**
2. Make an ASL sign (A, B, C, etc.)
3. **Expected Result**: 
   - Device 1 should detect the sign and add 10 points
   - Device 2 should see Player1's score increase by 10 points
4. Repeat on **Device 2**
5. **Expected Result**: 
   - Device 2 should detect the sign and add 10 points
   - Device 1 should see Player2's score increase by 10 points

### **Phase 4: Synchronization Verification**

#### **Step 8: Verify Real-time Sync**
1. Make multiple signs on both devices
2. **Expected Result**: Both devices should show identical scores at all times
3. Check that scores update within 1-2 seconds on both devices

#### **Step 9: Test Network Resilience**
1. If possible, test with devices on different networks
2. Make signs and verify scores still sync properly
3. Check logs for any connection errors

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **Issue 1: "No scores appearing"**
- **Check**: Camera permissions are enabled
- **Check**: Firebase connection in logs
- **Solution**: Use the TEST SCORE button first to verify scoring works

#### **Issue 2: "Scores not syncing between devices"**
- **Check**: Both devices show "Connected" status
- **Check**: Logs show "MESSAGE RECEIVED" and "MESSAGE SENT"
- **Solution**: Restart the app on both devices

#### **Issue 3: "Only one device can detect signs"**
- **Check**: Camera permissions on both devices
- **Check**: Model loading logs
- **Solution**: Ensure both devices have the same app version

#### **Issue 4: "Scores reset or double"**
- **Check**: No duplicate message handling in logs
- **Solution**: The periodic sync should prevent this

### **Log Messages to Monitor**

#### **Successful Connection:**
```
MultiplayerService: === STARTING MESSAGE LISTENER ===
MultiplayerService: Message listener added for room: [ROOM_CODE]
MultiplayerViewModel: === ANSWER SUBMITTED MESSAGE RECEIVED ===
MultiplayerScreen: === PERIODIC SCORE SYNC ===
```

#### **Successful Scoring:**
```
MultiplayerScreen: FORCE SCORING: Adding 10 points for letter 'A'
MultiplayerViewModel: === FORCE SCORE UPDATE ===
MultiplayerScreen: Both devices should now show same scores!
```

## üìä Expected Results

### **Scoring System:**
- **10 points per letter signed** (any ASL letter)
- **Real-time synchronization** between devices
- **No score doubling or resetting**
- **Accurate score display** on both devices

### **Performance:**
- **Score updates within 1-2 seconds**
- **Stable connection** throughout the game
- **No crashes or freezes**
